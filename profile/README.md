This organization hosts repositories that support the teaching and learning. It provides tools, examples, and reference implementations that help students engage with core programming ideas through practical exploration. 

The collection includes utility tools, small applications, and simple games that illustrate key concepts such as modular design, architectural experimentation, and communication patterns. These projects offer hands-on experience with software artifacts and continue to evolve as new teaching needs emerge, serving as a shared space for experimentation, demonstration, and learning by doing.
